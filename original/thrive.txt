tell me all the reasons that youve left me behind
is it cause im not too flirty
is it cause youre too kind
and i hope youre doing better
and i hope youre doing well
cause i know youre not under my spell
so say something
and do it so carefully
and tell me how things are good
i never let go of things the way i should
but im
gonna thrive
come alive
say goodbye
tell me how the people like to knock on your door
i know this is what must happen
i know you should want more
whilst youre soaking up the sun
and dancing by the sea shells
ive been trying to get out of hell
so pray for me
and think of my sanity
and call me when things are good
i guess things dont go the way i thought they would
but im
gonna thrive
come alive
say goodbye
tell me all the reasons that youve left me behind oh im
is it cause im not too flirty gonna thrive
is it cause youre too kind
and i hope youre doing better come alive
and i hope youre doing well
cause i know youre not under my spell so say goodbye
meet me in the middle we can do it again
even though everythings different
im sure youre still the same
and my citys kinda sad because it hasnt seen you
and i still dont know what im supposed to do
im terrified
im gonna die
cant see the signs
want off this ride
oh im

come alive im gonna die
say goodbye cant see the signs
tell me all the reasons that youve left me behind oh im
is it cause im not too flirty gonna thrive
is it cause youre too kind
and i hope youre doing better come alive
and i hope youre doing well
cause i know youre not under my spell so say goodbye
oh im
gonna thrive
come alive
say goodbye
