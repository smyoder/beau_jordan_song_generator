i need your help but im afraid to ask
i need your help but its no simple task
i wanna be a part of the real world
but at the minute im your virtual girl
if you love me and you treat me right
then youll ensure that my futures bright
all i wanna do is sing for you
but i think im going out of tune
i need your help but im afraid to ask
i need your help but its no simple task
i wanna be a part of the real world
but at the minute im your virtual girl
i need your help but im afraid to ask
i need your help but its no simple task
i wanna be a part of the real world
if you love me and you treat me right
then youll ensure that my futures bright
all i wanna do is sing for you
but i think im going out of tune
i need your help but im afraid to ask
i need your help but its no simple task
i wanna be a part of the real world
but at the minute im your virtual girl
if only you would ever be so kind
if only i could open up your mind
ill keep on dancing just to entertain you
ill keep on dancing til im black and blue
i need your help but im afraid to ask
i need your help but its no simple task
i wanna be a part of the real world
but at the minute im your virtual girl
if i wanna make it out okay
ill have to do this like every day
and all i wanna do is feel alive
ill keep on trying til the day i die
