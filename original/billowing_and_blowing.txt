i wonder if ill die
on my own
all alone
the sad reality
it frightens
it frightens me
the people throw their stones
they break my
all my bones
the worlds out to get me
im running
oh god theyre coming
oh dont look so upset
just face it
theres no way to escape it
its all inside of your mind
now its coming
its billowing and blowing
oh my god im trying
oh god they know im hiding
oh my god its coming
its billowing and blowing
it always ends in tears
despite all
all these years
theres nothing left to do
they tell me
its up to you
oh dont look so upset
just face it
you should learn to embrace it
youll have to leave them behind
now its coming
its billowing and blowing
oh my god im trying
oh god they know im hiding
oh my god its coming
its billowing and blowing

no more time for crying
no reason to be lying
