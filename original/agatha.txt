agatha
youve been working too hard
trying to prove a point
but they dont know who you are
agatha
do you think it really matters
when the wounds lead to scars
trying to prove a point
but they dont know who you are

how much time youve spent on your own
o the glimmer in your eye has gone
howd you get so cold
spending nights alone because you ache to the bone
