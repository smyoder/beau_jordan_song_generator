and ill never love again cause i fell too hard
guess i always shouldve known you would break my heart
now i gotta call a cleaner
to come up and pick the pieces off the floor
and now i cant love someone anymore
now youve gone and done what you did
guess i never shouldve kept
my emotions so hid from you
and now my lifes become such a bore
because i cant love someone anymore
