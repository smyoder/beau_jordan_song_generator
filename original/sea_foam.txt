if this is life i want no more
if this is love i feel no more
if this is choice dont wanna choose
if this is game im gonna lose
id rather be turned into stone
id rather turn back into dust
id rather be amongst the stars
return myself back to the sea
so let me become born again
wash upon the shores when i am
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
if this is it i think im done
if this is all ive had my fun
oh what a bore my lifes become
so if that is all ive had my fun
maybe its only for a day
maybe the fog is on its way
maybe the sky is yet to fall
under the sea id like to be
la la la
la la la
ah ah
ah ah
so let me become born again
wash upon the shores when i am
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
if this is life i want no more
if this is love i feel no more
if this is choice dont wanna choose
if this is game im gonna lose
id rather be turned into stone
id rather turn back into dust
id rather be amongst the stars
return myself back to the sea
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
sea foam
if this is life i want no more
if this is love i feel no more
if this is choice dont wanna choose
if this is game im gonna lose
id rather be turned into stone
id rather turn back into dust
id rather be amongst the stars
return myself back to the sea
la la la

ah ah
