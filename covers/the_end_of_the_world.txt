why does the sun go on shining
why does the sea rush to shore
dont they know its the end of the world
cause you dont love me any more
why do the birds go on singing
why do the stars glow above
dont they know its the end of the world
it ended when i lost your love
i wake up in the morning and i wonder
why everythings the same as it was
i cant understand no i cant understand
how life goes on the way it does
why does my heart go on beating
why do these eyes of mine cry
dont they know its the end of the world
it ended when you said goodbye
why does my heart go on beating
why do these eyes of mine cry
dont they know its the end of the world
it ended when you said goodbye
