ill never have any peace of mind
its true i know ill never find
ill never have any peace of mind
if it were physical it would show
if it were spiritual i would know

oh i never want to feel ashamed
i just cant bear that kind of pain
there is a need always divided yeah
from all the things that ive been hiding yeah
