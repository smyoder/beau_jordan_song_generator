youre king of the castle
whenever youre here you know it feels right
dont need to worry
dont need a moon ive got your spotlight
i want you to
do you want to
i want you to stay tonight
i want you to say i want you too
he never wants to strip down to his feelings
he never wants to kiss and close his eyes
he never wants to cry cry
i never really know when hell be leaving
and even with hello i hear goodbye
he always makes me cry cry
wake up without you
flooding my room i see your headlights
and you got your reasons
youve got a way that makes it alright
i want you to
do you want to
i want you to stay tonight
i want you to say i want you too
he never wants to strip down to his feelings
he never wants to kiss and close his eyes
he never wants to cry cry
i never really know when hell be leaving
and even with hello i hear goodbye
he always makes me cry cry
wake up without you
wake up without you
wake up without you
i wake up without you boy
cry cry
wake up without you
wake up without you
wake up without you
i wake up without you boy

youre king of the castle
whenever youre here you know it feels right
dont need to worry
he never wants to strip down to his feelings
he never wants to kiss and close his eyes
he never wants to cry cry
i never really know when hell be leaving
and even with hello i hear goodbye
he always makes me cry cry
