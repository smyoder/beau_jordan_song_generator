i lost my spine inside the center of a star
and every day i wonder where the bad bones are
youll die an ugly day if you hit and miss
i know my own granddaddy worked so hard for this
it seems so sinful living like a porcupine
i know youre dreaming of the time when you were mine
it seems so sinful it seems so sinful
ooh ooh
you kicked me out and hung a rope down from the roof
the christians came out they watched me tie my noose
i spoke a silent prayer they began crying
they knew that id applied to hell they knew i got in
it seems so sinful living like a porcupine
i know youre dreaming of the time when you were mine
it seems so sinful it seems so sinful
ooh ooh
it seems so simple now ooh
it seems so sinful ooh
it seems so sinful it seems so sinful
ooh
it seems so sinful it seems so sinful
ooh
it seems so sinful it seems so sinful
ooh
