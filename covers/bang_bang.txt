i was five and he was six
we rode on horses made of sticks
he wore black and i wore white
he would always win the fight
bang bang he shot me down
bang bang i hit the ground
bang bang that awful sound
bang bang my baby shot me down
seasons came and changed the time
when i grew up i called him mine
he would always laugh and say
remember when we used to play
bang bang i shot you down
bang bang you hit the ground
bang bang that awful sound
bang bang i used to shoot you down
music played and people sang
just for me the church bells rang
now hes gone i dont know why
and til this day sometimes i cry
he didnt even say goodbye
he didnt take the time to lie
bang bang he shot me down
bang bang i hit the ground
bang bang that awful sound
bang bang my baby shot me down
