youre here early but here
on a morning so clear and blue
is fate up for debate
and does my love only count if its proved
forget forgiveness forget all the rules
just please dont do it here
bring on the fire cause business is cruel
and sophies got somewhere to be
im not afraid
so take me outside
i know what youre here to do
shotgun up familiar sleeves
undercover but nobodys fooled no
got no time no time for goodbyes
oh god just let my love survive
forget forgiveness forget all the rules
just please dont do it here dont do it here
bring on the fire cause business is cruel
and sophies got somewhere to be
take it out on me
take it out on me
forget forgiveness forget all the rules
just please dont do it here dont do it here
bring on the fire cause business is cruel
just please dont do it here
take it out on me
take it out on me please dont do it here dont do it here
bring on the fire cause business is cruel
and sophies got somewhere to be
take it out on me
take it out on me
