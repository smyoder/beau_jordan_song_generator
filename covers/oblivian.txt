i never walk about after dark
its my point of view
cause someone could break your neck
coming up behind you
always coming and youd never have a clue
i never looked behind all the time
i will wait forever
always looking straight
thinking counting all the hours you wait
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
and no im not a jerk
i would ask if you could help me out
its hard to understand
cause when youre runnin by yourself
its hard to find someone to hold your hand
i know its good to be tough like me
but i would wait forever
i need someone else
to look into my eyes and tell me
girl you know youve got to watch your health
to look into my eyes and tell me
la la la la la
to look into my eyes and tell me
la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la
la la la la la
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
see you on a dark night
