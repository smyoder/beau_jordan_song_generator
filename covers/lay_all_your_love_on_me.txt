i wasnt jealous before we met
now every woman i see is a potential threat
and im possessive it isnt nice
youve heard me saying that smoking was my only vice
but now it isnt true
now everything is new
and all ive learned has overturned
i beg of you
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
it was like shooting a sitting duck
a little small talk a smile and baby i was stuck
i still dont know what youve done with me
a grown up woman should never fall so easily
i feel a kind of fear
when i dont have you near
unsatisfied i skip my pride
i beg you dear
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
dont go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me
ive had a few little love affairs
they didnt last very long and theyve been pretty scarce
i used to think that was sensible
it makes the truth even more incomprehensible
cause everything is new
and everything is you
and all ive learned has overturned
what can i do
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
dont go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
dont go sharing your devotion
lay all your love on me
dont go wasting your emotion
lay all your love on me
