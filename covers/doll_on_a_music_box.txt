what do you see
you people gazing at me
you see a doll on a music box thats
wound by a key
how can you tell
im under a spell
im waiting for loves first kiss
you cannot see
how much i long to be free
turning around on this music box thats
wound by a key
yearning
yearning
while im
turning around and around
